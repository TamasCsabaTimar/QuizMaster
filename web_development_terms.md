# Web Development Technical Terms Explained

This document provides explanations for key technical terms in web development.

## Full-Stack Web Application

A full-stack web application is a complete software solution that handles both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) aspects of web development. 

**Key components:**
- **Front-end**: The user-facing part of the application that runs in the web browser
- **Back-end**: The server-side logic, database interactions, and business processes
- **Database**: Storage for application data

Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing them to build complete web applications from start to finish. They understand how all parts of the web development process fit together.

## Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Readable syntax**: Uses indentation for code blocks instead of braces or keywords
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line by line rather than compiled ahead of time
- **Dynamically typed**: Variable types are determined at runtime
- **Multi-paradigm**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles
- **Extensive standard library**: Comes with "batteries included" for many common tasks

Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and many other fields due to its simplicity and powerful ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

## FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

**Key features:**
- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go
- **Easy to use**: Designed to be easy to use and learn
- **Type hints**: Uses Python type hints for parameter declaration, which provides:
  - Editor support with autocompletion
  - Type checking
  - Automatic documentation
- **Automatic documentation**: Generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI and ReDoc)
- **Based on standards**: Built on OpenAPI and JSON Schema

FastAPI is particularly well-suited for building RESTful APIs and microservices, and it's gaining popularity for its combination of speed, ease of use, and robust features.

## REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly web services.

**Key principles:**
- **Stateless**: Each request from client to server must contain all information needed to understand and process the request
- **Client-server architecture**: Separation of concerns between user interface and data storage
- **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable
- **Uniform interface**: Standardized way to interact with resources through:
  - Resource identification in requests (e.g., URLs)
  - Resource manipulation through representations
  - Self-descriptive messages
  - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
- **Layered system**: Client cannot ordinarily tell whether it's connected directly to the end server or an intermediary

RESTful APIs typically use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources, which are identified by URLs.

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

**Key aspects:**
- **Markup language**: Uses tags to define elements within a document
- **Structure**: Provides the basic structure of web pages
- **Semantic elements**: Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>` describe their meaning/purpose
- **Links**: Creates hyperlinks between pages and resources
- **Forms**: Enables user input and data submission
- **Embedded content**: Supports images, videos, and other media

HTML works alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for behavior) to create complete web experiences. The current standard is HTML5, which introduced many new features including improved support for multimedia, new semantic elements, and APIs for complex web applications.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.

**Key features:**
- **Separation of concerns**: Separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)
- **Selectors**: Target HTML elements to apply styles
- **Properties and values**: Define how elements should be displayed
- **Cascading**: Multiple style rules can apply to the same element
- **Inheritance**: Some properties are inherited by child elements
- **Responsive design**: Media queries allow different styles based on device characteristics
- **Animations and transitions**: Create visual effects without JavaScript

CSS has evolved significantly with CSS3, which introduced modules for features like flexbox and grid layouts, animations, transitions, and more sophisticated selectors.

## JS (JavaScript)

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the web.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Client-side scripting**: Traditionally runs in the browser to create dynamic web pages
- **Server-side development**: Can also run on servers with Node.js
- **Event-driven**: Responds to user actions and other events
- **Object-oriented**: Uses prototypal inheritance
- **Functional programming**: Supports first-class functions
- **Asynchronous programming**: Handles operations like API calls without blocking execution
- **DOM manipulation**: Can change HTML and CSS dynamically

JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is essential for modern web applications. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like React, Angular, and Vue.js) that simplify complex front-end development.

---

These technologies work together to create modern web applications:
- HTML provides structure and content
- CSS handles styling and layout
- JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior
- Python (with frameworks like FastAPI) powers the back-end
- REST principles guide API design for communication between front-end and back-end

Together, they form the foundation of full-stack web development.
